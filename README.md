# Sentiment Analysis

For those who enjoy watching anime but struggle to get started on new ones because they think it's not as good as the people who recommended it say it is, this project is for you! 

## Description

The Anime Recommendation Assistant helps you find the right anime to watch by providing detailed information about shows. Just type the name of an anime to get all the information that will help you make an informed decision. Save yourself some time and discover the best shows Japan has to offer!

I developed and trained a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to analyze and classify reviews for a given anime as either positive or negative.
